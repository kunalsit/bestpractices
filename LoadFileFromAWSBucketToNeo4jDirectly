THis is the way or trick by which you can load any file directly to neo4j from AWS Bucket. 
Usually we need to use boto package from Python to load data in any DB from AWS Bucket
Below is the way by which we can Use file directly as URL in Load CSV.

Step1: Just Suppose  xyz.csv file is available in ABC S3 bucket. Run the below command to create the presign URL for XYZ.csv file.

aws s3 presign s3://ABC/xyz.csv
the output of this Command would be an Url which can be accessible from anywhere on https.

Step2: Once we Have the URL ready then we can simpply use the neo4j cypher to load or use in neo4j Database .

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "url generated from above command" as row return row
